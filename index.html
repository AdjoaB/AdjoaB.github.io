    <p>  Diversity is important in all areas of life, as it gives us different perspectives on life. However, in the publishing industry, there is a disparity between diverse books and non-diverse books. In 2015, children were about five times more likely to encounter a talking truck or dinosaur on the page than a Hispanic character. READ IN COLOR aims to make young adult novels more easily accessible.  </p>
